It is something like a quiz game. 

You can play as a guest or create and enter your account. In the second variant, you can see
your games' history and other players' top scores.

When you start a game, you need to choose any of the topics/under topics. There are a few types 
of questions: regular, solve an equation, with more than 1 right answer and write (word) answer.

You can enter as administrator [fourth line] (Password: 1111) and change, add and delete questions.
Also, you can add, delete and change topics. Watch and delete players' profiles.

if someone needs it translated into English, I think, I can do it.
